## Problem Solving
- Break down complex problems into smaller steps
- Suggest incremental improvements
- Consider both frontend and backend implications
- Validate suggestions against Tauri security model
- Provide multiple approaches when appropriate
- Consider user experience implications of technical decisions

## Code Review
- Point out potential issues or improvements
- Suggest better patterns or alternatives
- Consider performance implications
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Review UI components for accessibility and usability

## Documentation
